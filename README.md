# Face-Recognition

## Description
Implemented Face Recognition system by using pretrained faceEvolve model and Faiss Indexer. It uses opencv libraries to manipulate images, capture images for further preprocessng.Pretrained faceEvolve model is in pytorch format which we use to calculate facial embedding vectors. The facial embedding vectors is used to calculate similarity in images through which we recognize the faces in the dataset. This system is implemented from GitHub repo [faceEvolve](https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe). You can find the pretrained model of faceEvolve in [faceEvolve](https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/face.evoLVe).
